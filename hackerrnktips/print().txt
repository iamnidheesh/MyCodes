Prints each element separated by space on a single line. Removing the comma at the end will print each element on a new line.

Let's import the advanced print_function from the __future__ module.

Its method signature is below:

print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout)

Here, you can add values separated by a comma. The arguments sep, end, and file are optional, but they can prove helpful in formatting output without taking help from a string module.

The argument definitions are below:
sep defines the delimiter between the values.
end defines what to print after the values.
file defines the output stream.

Interesting, isn't it?
